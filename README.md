## Presentation

I'm currently building a Scss library, a bunch of differents mixins, mainly on utilitary purpose
(centering elements with flexbox for example) and fast building elements (like arrows).
There's still a lot of work on it, many improvements before the library would really ready to use.

## Mixins

My mixins are classified by levels. Level 0 mixins will not use any arguments, Level 1 will. Then, Level 2 mixins will use level 0 and 1 mixins to make their duty.

## Documentation

I'll make a showcase Website once the library will be in BETA phase. For the moment, documentation is written above each mixin which needs documentation : Purpose of the mixin, arguments needed...
But also the optional arguments, I plan to make default arguments in some mixins in order to make them more flexible in their utilisation.

## Support

Feel very free to contact me if you have any question, something you don't understand, or an advice for me.
